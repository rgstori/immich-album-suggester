## ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Performance & Enhancement

### **NEW LOW PRIORITY ISSUES** ðŸš¨

10. **Inefficient Database Queries** ðŸ†•
    - `get_processed_asset_ids()` loads all asset IDs into memory
    - **Impact**: High memory usage with large photo libraries
    - **Fix**: Use database-side filtering or pagination

11. **Redundant Thumbnail Requests** ðŸ”„ **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**
    - Recent improvements: Better caching in table view, reduced duplicate requests
    - **Remaining Issue**: Some edge cases during view transitions
    - **Fix**: Implement request deduplication in caching layer

12. **Missing Graceful Degradation** ðŸ†•
    - UI breaks if VLM service is unavailable
    - **Fix**: Add graceful fallbacks and better error states

13. **No Telemetry/Metrics** ðŸ†•
    - No visibility into system performance or usage patterns
    - **Fix**: Add optional telemetry for clustering performance, VLM response times, etc.

## ðŸ”µ ENHANCEMENT - New Features

### **ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS** ðŸ†•

14. **Service Layer Testing** ðŸ†•
    - No unit tests for the new service architecture
    - **Fix**: Add comprehensive test suite for services

15. **Configuration Validation** ðŸ†•
    - No validation that config.yaml contains required fields
    - **Fix**: Add schema validation with helpful error messages

16. **Plugin Architecture for VLM Providers** ðŸ†•
    - Currently hardcoded to Ollama
    - **Enhancement**: Abstract VLM interface to support multiple providers

17. **Album Template System** ðŸ†•
    - Only basic title/description templates
    - **Enhancement**: Rich template system with conditional logic

### **UI ENHANCEMENTS** ðŸ†•

18. **Advanced Table Features** ðŸ†•
    - Additional sortable columns (title, location, status)
    - **Enhancement**: Implement database-level sorting for all columns
    - **Also**: Add filtering/search capabilities to table view

19. **Merge Preview** ðŸ†•
    - Basic merge confirmation implemented
    - **Enhancement**: Visual preview showing combined photo grid before merge
    - **Also**: Undo functionality for recently merged albums

20. **Bulk Status Operations** ðŸ†•
    - Current bulk operations: merge, enrich, delete
    - **Enhancement**: Bulk approve/reject, bulk status changes
    - **Also**: Batch album creation for approved suggestions

## Code Quality Metrics Target
- [ ] 100% type hint coverage for public APIs
- [ ] <5 broad exception handlers (`except Exception:`)
- [ ] Zero hardcoded configuration values
- [ ] All database operations in explicit transactions
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage for service layer

The refactoring has significantly improved the architecture, but there are still some critical security and stability issues that need immediate attention, particularly around thread safety and SQL injection in the migration code.
