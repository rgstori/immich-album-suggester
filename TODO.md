   - Thread-safe cache with automatic eviction
   - Suggestion-specific cache clearing

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM - User Experience Issues âœ… ALL COMPLETED

8. **Album View Missing Metadata** âœ… COMPLETED
   - Added comprehensive metadata display (photos, dates, locations, status)
   - Implemented interactive cover photo selection
   - Added editable titles and descriptions

9. **Poor Error Messages** âœ… COMPLETED
   - Replaced generic "X" with informative error messages
   - Added retry buttons for failed thumbnail loads
   - Improved logging with specific error details

10. **Inefficient Cache Clearing** âœ… COMPLETED
    - Implemented selective cache invalidation by suggestion ID
    - LRU cache automatically manages memory usage
    - Only clears relevant caches instead of everything

11. **Album Switching Issues** âœ… COMPLETED
    - Fixed misbehavior when switching between albums
    - Added proper loading states and progress indicators
    - Eliminated race conditions with dedicated switching logic

12. **Enrichment Workflow Problems** âœ… COMPLETED

    - Added status-aware UI with appropriate controls per state
    - Enhanced feedback when enriching currently viewed album

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Code Quality & Maintenance

11. **Broad Exception Handling**
    - Catch-all exception blocks hide specific errors
    - **Fix**: Use specific exception types

12. **Missing Type Hints**
    - No type annotations throughout codebase
    - **Fix**: Add comprehensive type hints

13. **Configuration Hardcoding**
    - Some values still hardcoded despite config.yaml
    - **Fix**: Move remaining hardcoded values to configuration

## NEW - Enhanced UI Features âœ… ALL COMPLETED
