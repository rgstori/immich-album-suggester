# TODO: Immich Album Suggester Improvements

## üî¥ CRITICAL - Core Functionality Gaps

These features address significant gaps that can lead to a poor user experience or incorrect behavior.

### **NO OUTSTANDING CRITICAL ISSUES** ‚úÖ

All critical core functionality gaps have been resolved and moved to the completed section.

## üü† HIGH - Stability & User Trust

These items focus on making the application more robust and the user's actions more predictable.

### **NO OUTSTANDING HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES** ‚úÖ

All high priority stability and user trust issues have been resolved.


## üü° MEDIUM - Code Quality & Maintainability

### **REFACTORING & COMPLEXITY REDUCTION** üÜï ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**

1. **~~Introduce Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)~~** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
   - **~~Problem~~**: ~~Heavy reliance on generic dictionaries (Dict[str, Any]) for data entities is error-prone~~
   - **~~Impact~~**: ~~Typo-prone keys, no IDE support, difficult static analysis~~
   - **~~Fix~~**: ~~Use dataclasses/TypedDict for core entities like Suggestion with centralized parsing logic~~
   - **‚úÖ SOLUTION**: Implemented comprehensive DTO system with `SuggestionAlbum`, `ImmichAlbum`, `VLMAnalysis`, `ClusteringCandidate`, and `PhotoAsset` dataclasses providing type safety, IDE support, and centralized data validation throughout the entire application

2. **Refactor Repetitive UI Rendering Logic** üÜï ‚≠ê
   - **Problem**: Duplicate thumbnail display code across render_photo_grid, render_weak_asset_selector, and sidebar
   - **Impact**: High maintenance burden, inconsistent UI behavior
   - **Fix**: Create reusable render_thumbnail_card() and format_suggestion_metadata() functions

3. **Generalize Pagination Logic** üÜï ‚≠ê
   - **Problem**: Separate pagination implementations for Core Photos and Weak Assets
   - **Impact**: Code duplication, inconsistent pagination behavior
   - **Fix**: Single render_pagination_controls() function with configurable page keys

4. **Decompose Complex Service Methods** üÜï ‚≠ê
   - **Problem**: Large methods like get_albums_with_metadata() do too many things
   - **Impact**: Hard to read, test, and maintain
   - **Fix**: Break into smaller helper methods (_fetch_all_albums_from_api, _extract_metadata_from_album_assets)

5. **Standardize Date Handling** üÜï ‚≠ê
   - **Problem**: Date parsing scattered across multiple files with inconsistent formats
   - **Impact**: Fragile date handling, potential bugs
   - **Fix**: Single utility function, consistent ISO 8601 storage, datetime objects for DB operations

### **TESTING & VALIDATION** üö®

6. **Service Layer Unit Testing** üÜï
   - **Problem**: The service layer containing all business logic is untested
   - **Impact**: Refactoring is risky; bugs can be introduced easily
   - **Fix**: Introduce pytest and pytest-mock, write unit tests for each service with mocked dependencies

7. **Configuration Schema Validation** üÜï
   - **Problem**: Invalid config.yaml (misspelled keys, wrong data types) leads to NoneType errors at runtime
   - **Impact**: Poor user experience on setup; hard-to-diagnose errors
   - **Fix**: Use Pydantic to define Config model with validation at startup

8. **VLM Provider Plugin Architecture** üÜï
   - **Problem**: VLM logic tightly coupled to Ollama's API
   - **Impact**: Difficult to switch to other providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
   - **Fix**: Abstract base class `VLMProvider`, concrete implementations, factory pattern

## üü¢ LOW - Performance & Enhancement

### **NEW LOW PRIORITY ISSUES** üö®

7. **Redundant Thumbnail Requests** üîÑ **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**
    - **Remaining Issue**: Some edge cases might trigger duplicate requests before cache is populated
    - **Fix**: Implement in-memory request deduplication lock with `in_flight_requests` set

8. **Missing Graceful Degradation in UI** üÜï
    - **Problem**: If VLM is configured but unavailable, enrichment fails hard with poor UI feedback
    - **Impact**: UI for `enrichment_failed` suggestion is not helpful
    - **Fix**: Allow manual title/description editing and approval with default metadata even after VLM failure

9. **No Telemetry/Metrics** üÜï
    - **Problem**: No visibility into system performance or usage patterns
    - **Fix**: Add optional telemetry for clustering performance, VLM response times, etc.

## üîµ ENHANCEMENT - New Features

These are new, high-value features that expand the application's capabilities beyond its current scope.

### **AI & Core Logic Enhancements** üÜï

      - Generate richer titles like "Alice's 5th Birthday Party" instead of "Event in August 2024"

11. **Semantic Search-Based Albums** üÜï
    - **Description**: Allow users to create albums based on text queries
    - **Enhancement**:
      - Add text input: "Create an album of... (e.g., 'all my photos of snowy mountains')"
      - Use text embedding model for query, cosine similarity search against photo embeddings
      - Return top N matching photos as new album suggestion

12. **Smarter Cover Photo & Highlight Selection** üÜï
